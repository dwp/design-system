# Roadmap

This is the roadmap for the DWP Design System. It shows what we plan to work on in the future. We update this plan regularly depending on the feedback, contributions and requests we receive. 

The roadmap was last updated in February 2022. See the [latest updates](/community/latest-updates) section for previously released features.
