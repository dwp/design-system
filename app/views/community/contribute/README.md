# Contribute

Anyone can contribute to the Design System by proposing a new component or pattern, helping to develop an existing component or pattern or adding research insights to existing components or patterns.

Before you start, check the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and the [DWP Design System Community Backlog](https://github.com/dwp/design-system-community-backlog/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested.

## To help develop a proposed pattern
- If your idea is already on the backlog, follow the link from the [backlog page](/community/backlog) to its GitHub issue or discussion. 
- Add your comments, feedback or examples of the component or pattern in use.
- The Design System team will get in touch to talk through your findings and discuss if more work is needed.


## To propose a new component or pattern
- If your idea is not on the backlog, you can [create a new backlog item in GitHub](https://github.com/dwp/design-system-community-backlog/issues/new). Tell us why you need the component or pattern and share any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.
- The Design System team will be in contact with you to help with the development of the new component or pattern.

## DWP Design Examples

[DWP Design Examples](https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTD/pages/131921347136/DWP+Design+Examples) (opens in Confluence) is a reference tool run by the DWP Interaction Design community. It includes interaction flows, components and patterns designers across DWP are working on to help solve user needs. Each design includes examples of its use and any research that has been gathered.
