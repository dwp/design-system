## August 2021
### Published manage a session timeout pattern

The pattern meets the [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 ‘Timing Adjustable’](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#timing-adjustable). This means that a service must warn users before a session timeout occurs and allow them to extend the session.

The pattern uses a modal dialog based on code from the [GOV.UK Design System community backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/30).

The [manage a session timeout pattern](/patterns/manage-a-session-timeout) includes:
- the full journey for the session timeout
- guidance for the length of the timeout
- a modal dialog box
- recommended content for users who are signed in or not signed in to a service
- an example of the session timeout for users with devices not running JavaScript
