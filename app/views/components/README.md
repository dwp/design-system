# Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that designers across DWP have made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](/patterns) and contexts. For example, the [timeline](/components/timeline) component can be used at the side of the page or on a page of its own.

These components should be used in addition to those in theÂ <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a>. We will share the design and research of these components with the GOV.UK Design System so they can be used more widely.
